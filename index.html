        <h2>This is Me.</h2>
        <p> My name is Derrick James Jr. I'm from Irvington Township in New Jersey. If I'm not on my computer at any given moment, ususally I am off playing card games with some of my older friends or playing video games in my house. I am what people would call a "Math Kid." I love math so much to the point at which it became the only subject in school i always caught on very quickly to. Due to my moderate to extreme amount of time spent playing varieties of video games, I've been entralled by the world of coding and have gained the new found love of making anything code-related from scratch. </p>
        <p> What i can bring to any group of dvelopers is a very can-do attitude. I can listen to instructions very well and I'm always open to new ideas and suggestions as well as benig able to offer any opinions and insight I can offer. I'm also a very hard worker and am usually ver focused to the point on which i usually dedicate any open time to anything of vital importance to myself or any other person. I can also be very unselfish. I am a very good team player and am always willing to take a backseat to a further experienced individual to learn more or to take direction from. </p>
