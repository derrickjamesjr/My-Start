# My Start into the World of Coding!

## To whomever is reading said document, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Derrick James and the document you are about to see is the resume which in turn holds the vast amount of knowledge i received from my time learning the simplicities and the complexities of coding from front-end to back-end. If there are any questions you have to learn more about me or about anything pertaining to my coding knowledge, feel free to contact me using any imformation found in the Talk to Me section. I respond very quickly and am happy to clarify any and all issues. I hope what I have to offer is something you were looking for. Thank you for using valuable free time to consider me. Have a nice day!
